# Asteroid-Belt
This is the game asteroid belt from the 1982 book Computer Spacegames. 
Ported to Mbasic to run on my SC108/RC2014 style z80. 
There are some minor tweaks to get it to run but fundamentally the game from the book in its original form.
Hardly the most inspiring game ever created but an interesting exercise in porting the code.
